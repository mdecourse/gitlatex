<p>LaTeX (pronouncedlay-tek) is a document preparation system for producing professional-looking documents, it is not a word processor.</p>

<p>The \documentclass command must appear at the start of every LATEX document. The text in the curly brackets specifies the document class. The article document class is suitable for shorter documents such as journal articles and short reports. Other document classes include report (for longer documents with chapters, e.g. PhD theses), proc (conference proceedings), book and slides. The text in the square brackets specifies options — in this case it sets the paper size to A4 and the main font size to 12pt.</p>
<p>The \begin{document} and \end{document} commands  enclose  the  textand commands that make up your document.  Anything typed before \begin{document} is known as the preamble, and will affect the whole document. Anything typed after \end{document} is ignored.</p>
<p>You can label any of the sectioning commands so they can be referred to in other parts of the document.  Label the section with \label{labelname}. Then type \ref{labelname} or \pageref{labelname}, when you want to refer to the section or page number of the label.</p>
<p>If you use sectioning commands it is very easy to generate a table of contents. Type \tableofcontents where you want the table of contents to appear in your document — often directly after the title page. You may also want to change the page numbering so that roman numerals (i, ii, iii) are used for pages before the main document starts.  This will also ensure that the main document starts on page 1.  Page numbering can be switched between arabic and roman using \pagenumbering{...}.</p>
<p>The\newpage command inserts a page break so that we can see the effect of the page numbering commands.</p>
<p>To put coloured text in your document you need to use apackage.  There are many packages that can be used with LATEX to enhance its functionality. Packages are included in the preamble (i.e. before the \begin{document} command). Packages are activated using the \usepackage[options]{package} command, where packageis the name of the package and optionsis an optional list of keywords that trigger special features in the package.</p>
<p>The basic colour names that \usepackage{color} knows about are black, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow and white.</p>
<p>The following symbols are reserved characters which have a special meaningin LATEX:</p>
<p>$ % ^ &amp; _ { } ~ \</p>
<p>All of these apart from the backslash \ can be inserted as characters in your document by adding a prefix backslash: \#  \$  \%  \^{} \&amp;  \_  \{  \}  \~{}.</p>
<p>Note that you need to type a pair of curly brackets {} after the hat ^ and tilde ~, otherwise these will appear as accents over the following character. For example, "\^ e" produces "ˆe".The above code will produce: # $ % ˆ &amp; { }  ̃. The backslash character \can not be entered by adding a prefix backslash, \\, as this is used for line breaking. Use the \textbackslask command instead.</p>
